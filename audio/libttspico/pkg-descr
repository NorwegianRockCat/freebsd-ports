SVOX Pico is a very compact multilingual Text-To-Speech (TTS) library.
It was designed for integration in mobile devices and includes female
voices for English (US and GB), French, German, Italian, and Spanish,
each of which takes about 1 MiB of disk space on a 64-bit x86 system.

Pico TTS was originally open-sourced for Android. This version is the
one maintained by Debian. They consider it to be non-free because the
binary language files don't come with the corresponding source code.
However, formats for both source and binary versions of the lingware
knowledge bases seem to be well documented, and it's all Apache 2.0.
Also, lingware source IS included, but not that for the build tools.
