A set of plugins for publishing and subscribing to sensor_msgs/Image
topics in representations other than raw pixel data. For example,
for viewing a stream of images off-robot, a video codec will give
much lower bandwidth and latency. For low frame rate tranport of
high-definition images, you might prefer sending them as JPEG or
PNG-compressed form.
