This package allows you to publish the state of a robot to tf2.
Once the state gets published, it is available to all components
in the system that also use tf2.  The package takes the joint angles
of the robot as input and publishes the 3D poses of the robot links,
using a kinematic tree model of the robot. The package can both be
used as a library and as a ROS node.  This package has been well
tested and the code is stable. No major changes are planned in the
near future.
