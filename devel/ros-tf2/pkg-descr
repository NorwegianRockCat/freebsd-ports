tf2 is the second generation of the transform library, which lets
the user keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. tf2
maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a tree
structure buffered in time, and lets the user transform points,
vectors, etc between any two coordinate frames at any desired point
in time.
