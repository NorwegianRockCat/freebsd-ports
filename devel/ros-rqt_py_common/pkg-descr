rqt_py_common provides common functionality for rqt plugins written
in Python.  Despite no plugin is provided, this package is part of
the rqt_common_plugins repository to keep refactoring generic
functionality from these common plugins into this package as easy
as possible.  Functionality included in this package should cover
generic ROS concepts and should not introduce any special dependencies
beside "ros_base".
