This package holds the diagnostic messages which provide the
standardized interface for the diagnostic and runtime monitoring
systems in ROS. These messages are currently used by the diagnostics
Stack, which provides libraries for simple ways to set and access
the messages, as well as automated ways to process the diagnostic
data.  These messages are used for long term logging and will not
be changed unless there is a very important reason.
