rostopic contains the rostopic command-line tool for displaying
debug information about ROS Topics, including publishers, subscribers,
publishing rate, and ROS Messages. It also contains an experimental
Python library for getting information about and interacting with
topics dynamically. This library is for internal-use only as the
code API may change, though it does provide examples of how to
implement dynamic subscription and publication behaviors in ROS.
