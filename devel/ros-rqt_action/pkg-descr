rqt_action provides a feature to introspect all available ROS action
(from actionlib) types. By utilizing rqt_msg, the output format is
unified with it and rqt_srv. Note that the actions shown on this
plugin is the ones that are stored on your machine, not on the ROS
core your rqt instance connects to.
